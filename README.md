# NM-classes
The repository includes three mini-projects created for Numerical Methods' classes at my university. Solutions were written in MATLAB language.

Every project contains a report providing mathematical explanation to the solution. The topics of the projects are:
  1. "LU-decomposition of matrices using the Crout's method",
  2. "Computation of integrals using Simpson's and Newton's rules",
  3. "Application of the midpoint method for a system of two ordinary differential equations".
